# Vehicle Detection System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a vehicle detection system using YOLOv5 and Python. The system is capable of identifying various objects such as vehicles, humans, traffic lights, and other modes of transportation with a 60% accuracy rate. 

## Features
- Utilizes YOLOv5 for object detection
- Detects vehicles, humans, traffic lights, and other objects
- Achieves a classification accuracy of 60%

## Dataset and Training
The YOLOv5 model was trained using a custom dataset. The training process was conducted on Google Colab GPUs, specifically utilizing the L4 and T4 GPUs for optimal performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv5
- Google Colab
